Allows network admin to send organizational messages to blog admins. Includes read confirmation.

== Description ==

This plugin allows network admin to send organizational messages to blog admins within blog administration. 

Main features:

* Every blog admin sees an notification until they mark all messages as read.
* Network admin has control over these notifications - can view who has not read which message yet and can delete notifications manually
* Message contains title (with or without URL), current date  and the content (which can contain HTML)
* Notifications are shown to admins of blogs active in time of it's creation. (probably will be adjustable in the future)

Makes use of the Wordpress Logging Service.

Developed for private use, but has perspective for more extensive usage. I can't guarantee any support in the future nor further development, but it is to be expected. Kindly inform me about bugs, if you find any, or propose new features: [zaantar@zaantar.eu](mailto:zaantar@zaantar.eu?subject=[organizational-message-notifier]).
